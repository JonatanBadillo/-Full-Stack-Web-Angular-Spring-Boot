# InventoryApp: Your First Full Stack Web App with Angular and Spring Boot

Welcome to my repository of a full stack web application using the powerful technologies of Angular and Spring Boot with Java. 

## Technologies Used

### Front End with Angular:

- **Angular Components:** Angular components using TypeScript to structure and organize your user interface.

- **Bootstrap for CSS Styles:** Bootstrap to give our web application an attractive style and layout.

- **Asynchronous HTTP Requests:** Explore handling asynchronous HTTP requests to interact with our backend and dynamically update the user interface.

### Back End with Spring Boot and Java:

- **REST Controller with Spring:** Create a RESTful controller with Spring to handle HTTP requests and manage business logic.

- **Testing with Postman:** Perform tests with Postman to validate and verify the correct operation of our REST operations.

- **Service Layer with Spring:** Implement a service layer to encapsulate business logic and maintain clean, modular code.

- **Data Layer with JPA and Hibernate:** Use JPA (Java Persistence API) along with Hibernate to interact with the database and efficiently manage entities.

- **Database Connection with MySQL:** Establish a connection to a MySQL database to store and retrieve inventory data.
